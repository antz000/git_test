Hello world! Hello Philippines!

My name is Manu.Antz. Today I'm studying about how Git works.
I'am a complete noob in programming but I know that I'll be better soon.


Guide me Lord. Thank you!

Today, I will start my first project from The Odin Project. It's a 
recipe website and I'm making this update just to test Git since I 
forgot how to use this.

Thanks!
